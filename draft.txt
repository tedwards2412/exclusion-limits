INTRODUCTION

So you want to set an upper limit?
Then you've come to the right place. 
The search for dark matter has been going on for more than half a century now and no one has found a convincing signal which is why our community lives and breathes upper limits.
We know how it feels.
You build a fantastic experiments, perform scrupulous measurements, and find nothing.
It sucks, but not the end of the world - you can set an upper limit.
But how?
Don't fear, we are here to help you set the best (probably just correct...) constraints you can!

Let us start by defining the purpose of this particular post. The idea of this post is not to produce an exhaustive list of all possible methods and to that end.

This will:
- A basic run down of what an upper limit means in technical and nontechnical language
- An easy guide on how to use the maximum likelihood ratio method to set an upper limit
- An explanation of the concept of coverage and why it’s important
- Complemented by coded examples for you to use in your own projects or to play around with to gain intuition
- A good place to start with helpful references

This will NOT:
- A conclusive guide on how to set an upper limit in any situation ever conceived
- Replace an actual scientific paper
- Be completely mathematically rigorous


UPPER LIMIT INTRODUCTION

So, upon first site an upper limit is used when we want to "exclude" parts of the parameter space. 
This immediately implies that we have some parameter space to exclude, usually part of a favourite model or perhaps scientific communities best hope. 
Either way placing limits is a *almost exclusively* model dependent. 
By model here we simply mean something you use to describe the data on hand. 
Now, usually a model has many parameters which presents problems when you want to display an upper limit on a 2D plot. 
For simplicity we will therefore just look at the basic example of two parameters like considered in most dark matter searches.

So lets take at just what a limit plot might look like. The Fermi-LAT telescope performs observations of our local dwarf galaxies from which we expect a large amount of dark matter annihilation signal. Now lets not get into what that means and only use this as a signal vs background discussion. Taking a look at the plot we see two parameters on the x and y axis, the dark matter mass and the velocity averaged cross section respectively. Both of these parameters appear in the calculation required to model the expected signal which is precisely the important step. The correct way to read a plot like this is to take a value of the dark matter mass (x axis) and trace vertically until you meet the black dashed line labelled ‘Median Expected’. The paper quotes this line as a 95% confidence level limit meaning that if 100 identical Fermi-LAT experiments were to calculate the expected signal at a given mass, 95 of would be consistent with the no signal i.e. the null hypothesis. @SL{Need to check and discuss best phrasing here}
