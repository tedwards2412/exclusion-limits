## Exclusion limits - A Complete Guide

The purpose of this repository is to collect and explain the concepts associated 
with exclusion limits.
Our aim is to keep it a stand alone resource such that it is understandable with relatively basic knowledge of statistics.
We will provide relevant references to either books or lectures notes at points of assumed knowledge.

Most of the text will be written in the form of Jupyter notebooks within this repository 
but there will most likely be an accompanying document where we elaborate on the mathematics 
behind the concepts used here.
The notebooks will contain coded examples for the majority of the concepts we introduce throughout the text.  

Below we have a series of links to the different chapters with short descriptions.
