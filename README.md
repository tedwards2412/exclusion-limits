## Exclusion limits - A Complete Guide

The purpose of this repository is to collect and explain the concepts associated 
with exclusion limits (often known as upper limits). We aim to make it a stand alone 
project such that it is understable with relatively basic knowledge of statistics. We 
will try to provide references to either books or lectures notes at points of assumed 
knowledge.

Most of the text will be written in the form of jupyter notebooks within this repository 
but there will most likely be an accompanying document where we ellaborate on the mathematics 
behind the concepts used here. The notebooks will contain coded examples for the majority 
of the concepts we introduce throughout the text.  

Below we have a series of links to the different chapters and a one line description of 
whats contained within.
