# So you want to set an Upper limit?

## General

- Plan is to kleep the language as simple as possible whilst maintaining accuracy - tend towards over explaining
- Nice to provide many useful links and also code for examples
- Approximately 3 A4 pages is probably a good aim (Long Read - 1500 words)

## Outline — article 1

#### Introduction to Upper Limit

- What is an upper limit? - Technical definition followed by what the hell does that mean
- Why do we set upper limits
- Establish that this is not an exhaustive guide for all methods but we address the most common method
- Plant ourselves in the Frequentist world - why for upper limits
- Concept of coverage introduced here

#### Test Statistics 

- What is a test statistic
- What test statistic is most commonly used - Likelihood ratio - links here to what is a likleihood
- Why is the maximum likelihood ratio a good TS
-- Wilks Theorem 
-- When does Wilks theorem apply

#### How to use this to set an upper limit

- Detailed steps on how to use the maximum likelihood ratio when Wilks theorem applies
- Few Examples. Maybe outside of Physics?

#### Common Pitfalls

- Present a list of times this might not work

#### Round up

- Bullet point list of steps to check your upper limit is correct
- Any other remarks

## Outline — article 2

#### What to do if Wilks theorem does not apply

- Use Monte Carlos - brief explanation of a MC but mainly links
- Show examples
