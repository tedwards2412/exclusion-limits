## Exclusion limits and associated concepts

- Plan is to keep the language as simple as possible whilst maintaining accuracy - tend towards over explaining
- Aim to provide useful links and coded examples of core concepts
- Early PhD students and masters students are the target audience.
They already have some knowledge of random variables and probability distributions and
have come across upper limits before but no knowledge of how to set them.
- End goal is to fully explain and compute/produce an upper limit and brazil plot
- Potential to expand to an exclusion limit cookbook
- Unclear if we want to discuss actual measurement of signal i.e. closed contour stuff

## Outline

#### Introduction to Exclusion Limits

- What is an exclusion limit? - Technical definition followed colloquial version
- Why do we set exclusion limits?
- Establish that this is not an exhaustive guide for all methods but we address the common methods
- Plant ourselves in the Frequentist world - why for exclusion limits
- Concept of coverage introduced here

#### Test Statistics 

- What is a test statistic
- What test statistic is most commonly used - Likelihood ratio
- Why is the maximum likelihood ratio a good TS
-- Wilks Theorem 
-- When does Wilks theorem apply

#### How to use this to set an exclusion limit

- Detailed steps on how to use the maximum likelihood ratio when Wilks theorem applies
- Few Examples. Colliders, line search indirect DM, and cosmology example?

#### Common Pitfalls

- Present a list of times this might not work and why
-- Wilks Theorem limits of rough validity
-- Downward fluctuations in the background
- Show how previous examples might fail

#### What to do if Wilks theorem does not apply

- Monte Carlos discussion
- Show examples

#### Diagnostics

- Visulation tools
-- Contour plots
-- Mutlidimensional stuff here
- Any other remarks
